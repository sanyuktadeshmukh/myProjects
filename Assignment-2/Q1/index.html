            <h1 align="center"><u>Frontend</u></h1>
            <p><b>What is frontend?</b><br>Frontend web development, also known as client-side development is the practice of producing HTML, CSS and JavaScript for a website or Web Application so that a user can see and interact with them directly. The challenge associated with front end development is that the tools and techniques used to create the front end of a website change constantly and so the developer needs to constantly be aware of how the field is developing.
            <br>
            The objective of designing a site is to ensure that when the users open up the site they see the information in a format that is easy to read and relevant. This is further complicated by the fact that users now use a large variety of devices with varying screen sizes and resolutions thus forcing the designer to take into consideration these aspects when designing the site. They need to ensure that their site comes up correctly in different browsers (cross-browser), different operating systems (cross-platform) and different devices (cross-device), which requires careful planning on the side of the developer.</p>

            <dl style="font-size:17px;">
                <dt style="font-size:20px;"><b>AngularJS</b></dt>
                <dd>AngularJs is a JavaScript open-source front-end framework that is mainly used to develop single-page web applications(SPAs). It is a continuously growing and expanding framework which provides better ways for developing web applications. It changes the static HTML to dynamic HTML. It is an open-source project which can be free. It extends HTML attributes with Directives, and data is bound with HTML.</dd>
                <dt style="font-size:20px;"><b>React.js</b></dt>
                <dd>React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. ReactJS is an open-source, component-based front-end library responsible only for the view layer of the application. It is maintained by Facebook. Moreover, React Js makes Front-end development very easy. You can now develop industry-ready Web Applications by enrolling in Geeksforgeeks React JS (Basic to Advanced)-A self-Paced course. 
                Bootstrap: Bootstrap is a free and open-source tool collection for creating responsive websites and web applications. It is the most popular HTML, CSS, and JavaScript framework for developing responsive, mobile-first websites.</dd>
                <dt style="font-size:20px;"><b>jQuery</b></dt>
                <dd>jQuery is an open-source JavaScript library that simplifies the interactions between an HTML/CSS document, or more precisely the Document Object Model (DOM), and JavaScript. Elaborating on the terms, jQuery simplifies HTML document traversing and manipulation, browser event handling, DOM animations, Ajax interactions, and cross-browser JavaScript development.</dd>

            <h1 align="center"><u>Backend</u></h1>
            <p><b>What is backend?</b><br>
                Nothing, really, at least not to the user. However, the back-end is always chugging along behind the scenes to power the front-end experience for visitors.
                <br>
                Take this blog post, for example; how did this front-end get to your computer in the first place? The text, image, and code files for this post are stored in a database on a HubSpot web server. When you (or, to be exact, your browser) request to view this web page, that request gets sent to the server. The server then “serves” those files to your browser. This is the back-end at work.
                <br>
                When you submit a form, that data gets stored in an organized database, accessed to send you an email. These operations are also part of the back-end and thus the responsibility of back-end developers.
                <br>
                This is the gist of back-end development: fielding user data from the front-end of an application, storing it, performing a variety of operations on this stored data, and sending data back to the front end. Back-end developers come up with the solutions and write the code to make all of this happen.</p>
